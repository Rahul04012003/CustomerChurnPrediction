    "# TELECOM CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION ðŸ“ˆ\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "Customer churn prediction is a critical aspect for businesses, especially in the telecom sector, where customer retention directly impacts profitability. The goal of this project is to develop a model to predict whether a customer will churn based on various features related to customer behavior and service usage. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the methodology, findings, and results obtained from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "Data Overview\n",
    "The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, account information, and usage statistics. Key columns include customer ID, tenure, contract type, payment method, monthly charges, total charges, and churn status.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "Missing Values: Analyzed and visualized missing values using missingno library. Missing values were handled appropriately by either imputing or dropping based on the feature context.\n",
    "Data Types: Ensured correct data types for each feature, particularly converting categorical features to appropriate formats.\n",
    "### Data Visualization\n",
    "Distribution Analysis: Visualized distributions of numerical features (e.g., tenure, monthly charges) using histograms and box plots.\n",
    "Categorical Analysis: Analyzed categorical features (e.g., contract type, payment method) using bar charts and pie charts.\n",
    "Correlation Analysis: Used heatmaps to identify correlations between numerical features and the target variable (churn).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations During Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- **Univariate Analysis**\n",
    "   1. **Customer Demographics:**\n",
    "     The majority of customers were senior citizens, indicating a potential target segment for retention strategies.\n",
    "Gender distribution was roughly equal, suggesting no gender bias in churn behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. **Account Information:**\n",
    "       Tenure showed a right-skewed distribution with many customers having short tenures. Monthly charges varied widely, with a notable concentration of customers paying medium-range charges. Total charges were naturally correlated with tenure and monthly charges, showing a broad range due to varying service durations and package selections.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   3. **Service Usage:**\n",
    "       Most customers opted for month-to-month contracts, followed by one-year and two-year contracts. Electronic check was the most common payment method, followed by mailed check, bank transfer, and credit card. Internet service usage was high, with a significant number of customers also subscribing to additional services like online security and device protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bivariate Analysis**\n",
    "    1. **Numerical Features:**\n",
    "       Tenure had a negative correlation with churn, indicating that customers with longer tenures were less likely to churn. Higher monthly charges were associated with higher churn rates, suggesting that cost might be a factor influencing customer decisions to leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Categorical Features:**\n",
    "       Customers with month-to-month contracts had the highest churn rate, compared to those with one-year or two-year contracts. Payment methods like electronic check had higher churn rates, while bank transfer and credit card had lower churn rates. Customers with additional services such as online security, online backup, and device protection tended to churn less, implying the value of bundled services.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Service Usage vs. Churn:**\n",
    "       Customers without internet service had significantly lower churn rates, indicating that internet-related issues might contribute to customer dissatisfaction. Customers with fiber optic internet had higher churn rates compared to those with DSL, suggesting potential quality or pricing issues with fiber optic services.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correlation Analysis**\n",
    "    1. **Heatmap Insights:**\n",
    "       A strong positive correlation was observed between total charges and tenure. Monthly charges were moderately correlated with churn, reinforcing the observation that higher charges could be a churn predictor. Features like contract type, payment method, and tenure had noticeable correlations with churn, guiding further feature engineering and model building steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Feature Engineering\n",
    "Feature Encoding\n",
    "### Label Encoding: \n",
    "Applied to binary categorical features (e.g., gender, partner, dependents).\n",
    "### One-Hot Encoding: \n",
    "Used for multi-class categorical features (e.g., contract type, payment method).\n",
    "Feature Scaling\n",
    "Standard Scaling: Applied to numerical features to normalize the data, ensuring that each feature contributes equally to the model training process.\n",
    "New Features\n",
    "Interaction Terms: Created new features by combining existing ones (e.g., tenure multiplied by monthly charges) to capture interactions that may influence churn.\n",
    "## 4. Model Building\n",
    "- **Models Used**\n",
    "    1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "    2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "    3. Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "    4. Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Selection**\n",
    "A variety of classification algorithms were evaluated to determine the best model for predicting churn. Each model was trained and tested using the same dataset for consistency.\n",

    "Optimal hyperparameters were critical for improving model performance. Extensive hyperparameter tuning was performed using Grid Search and Random Search techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Business Insights\n",
    "- **Customer Retention Strategies:**\n",
    "  Focus on customers with month-to-month contracts, offering incentives to switch to longer-term contracts. Address cost concerns by offering discounts or customized packages to customers with higher monthly charges. Enhance the quality and pricing of fiber optic services to reduce churn among fiber optic users. Promote bundled services (e.g., online security, backup) as they are associated with lower churn rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Payment Methods:**\n",
    "  Investigate issues related to electronic check payments, which had higher churn rates, and consider promoting more stable payment options like bank transfers or credit cards.\n",
